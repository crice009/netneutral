      Net Neutrality is Important
    </h1>
    <p>
      I built this tiny website on a cell phone in the time it took to have a cup of coffee. Having that kind 
      oof all-the-time access to the full internet is what allows people to go from idea to reality in a short
      time frame. In other words, a free and open internet is what allows for innovation. The exact opposite of 
      the alleged cause of the FCC's decision on December 11th, 2017.

      Many people I care about know that the end of net neutrality is bad, but they're hard pressed to say 
      exactly why. Let this small website be a guide. <A href='https://m.ranker.com/list/what-is-net-neutrality/donn-saylor?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=comicspost&pgid=763663430350503&utm_campaign=what-is-net-neutrality'>HERE</a> is a comic that someone made to try 
      and illustrate what the end of net neutrality could look like. <a href='https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative'>HERE</a> 
      Is a link to the government page that helps you find the contact information for your own Congressional 
      Representatives. <a href='https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm'>THIS</a> 
      link will help you find your Senator. <a href='https://lifehacker.com/how-to-petition-congress-and-state-officials-to-save-ne-1821330209'
      HERE</a> is a linj to an article that has much more information about net neutrality and how to do something about it.
